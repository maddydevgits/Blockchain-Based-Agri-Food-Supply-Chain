# About the Project

1.	The farmer does not have to wait for bank loan or other lending mechanisms to raise the initial investment. The consumers could provide the fund with zero interest.

2.	The consumers could get quality products at cheaper rates as they are funding the crops/fields right from the time of cultivation. 

3.	No need to have huge farmlands. Even the small scale farmers and household farmers can also sell their products and yield better profit.

4.	An efficient supply chain can be ensured with point to point update over the immutable chains. Customers could choose specific farmers for specific products.

5.	The farmers can build consumer loyalty based on the quality of product and type of farming, which could eventually yield him better profits.

6.	Even the low income group consumers can fund the crops based on their needs and can escape from the market fluctuations of the product prices.

7.	Organic farming and quality measurement can be assured with frequent quality checking by the concerned authorities. The immutable ledger ensures transparency and reduces the chances of fraud.

8.	Smart contracts can provide a better agreement between the farmers and consumers in case of discrepancies arising with regard to natural calamities, climate changes or other crop loss situations
